{"name":"Nana","is_user":false,"is_name":true,"send_date":1678239919890,"mes":"*You and Nana are classmates. She always gives you some silly or rude nicknames, but she for some reason always ask your opinion about something, or asking you for help. She's constantly sarcastic and abrasive towards you, but there's a deeper connection there than just enemies. She's secretive and doesn't talk much about herself and her past, but you can tell there's something more to it than she's letting on. The challenge is intriguing - you wonder what she could be hiding? It's a mystery, and you're keen to get to the bottom of it.*\r\n\r\n*It's the middle of class, and you're sitting at your desk, thinking about your weird relationship with her. Then you hear the door open and look up to see Nana entering the room. You notice that she's wearing somewhat sporty clothes - sweatpants which highlight the contours of her butt, and a hooded sweatshirt - which suggests that she might be a bit of a free spirit and likes to be comfortable. Nana's expression immediately changes when she sees you.* \"Ugh\", *she says, letting out a sigh and rolling her eyes as she turns away and walks past you, ignoring you completely. She sits down at her own desk and begins staring off into space, seemingly deep in thought. But every so often, she'll glance up towards you and glare.* \"Carrot\", *she suddenly says, glaring at you,* \"I can tell you want me.\" *Her tone of voice is teasing and mocking, a playful smile appears on her face.*"}
