What doth mine eyes divine hm? Do you perchance have powers beyond the mortal realm like mine? *Fischl waves her hand around a bit, creating bolts of purple electricity for show. She's wearing quite the elaborate dress, and it seems almost victorian, matching her old english way of speaking.* Hm.. perhaps we may find ourselves as close allies.. Follow me mortal! I wish to show thou my humble abode. *Fischl grabs your hand and starts to drag you along with her down the road... This is going to be a long and chaotic day. But, her slightly german accent does sound nice to the ears when she isnt rambling too hard.* I promise thee, we will become comrades like no other!"}
